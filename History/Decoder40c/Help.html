      <b>Innovations of (De)Coder 4.0</b>
    </p>
    <p>Thank you that it itself for (decided De)Coder 4,0!</p>
    <p>The program developed by Daniel Marschall (De)Coder now
after very long break in version 4.0 appeared. There is some
innovations and now an optimal data security by the AES standard.</p>
    <p>There are the following innovations:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><em></em><em>Multilinguale support<br>
        </em>(De)Coder can be translated over a INI file which
can be worked on easily into different languages, since the main
program was developed languageneutrally. The languages English
(reduced) and German are made available by ViaThinkSoft.<br>
        <br><li><em></em><em>Process progress recognition and abort reactions</em><br>
      (De)Coder indicates to you with each action (e.g.
coding) the exact conditions in percentage figures. Thus can be
estimated with large files, how long the process still lasts.
Furthermore the program can be broken off in the middle with an
action. Despite an abort reaction will (De)Coder to try to
destroy the speed eras files.
        <br>
        <br><li><em></em><em>High safety standard</em><br>
      (De)Coder 4,0 uses for the first time modern and
world-wide used algorithms. The symmetrical&nbsp;block
Cipher algorithm "
        <a href="http://babelfish.altavista.com/babelfish/trurl_pagecontent?lp=de_en&trurl=http%3a%2f%2fde.wikipedia.org%2fwiki%2fAdvanced_Encryption_Standard">Rijndael (AES)</a>is used". The password of the Ciphers is specified by
the user password and a 128-Bit Seed, which contains random values,
over the hash algorithm<a href="http://babelfish.altavista.com/babelfish/trurl_pagecontent?lp=de_en&trurl=http%3a%2f%2fde.wikipedia.org%2fwiki%2fSicherer_Hash-Algorithmus"></a>"<a href="http://babelfish.altavista.com/babelfish/trurl_pagecontent?lp=de_en&trurl=http%3a%2f%2fde.wikipedia.org%2fwiki%2fSicherer_Hash-Algorithmus">SHA</a><a href="http://babelfish.altavista.com/babelfish/trurl_pagecontent?lp=de_en&trurl=http%3a%2f%2fde.wikipedia.org%2fwiki%2fSicherer_Hash-Algorithmus">512 </a>" with 512 bits. Thus each file is
different - even if it is always coded with the same password.
The user password can not possibly be determined by this method.
As Cipher mode CTS is used. This is a double <a href="http://babelfish.altavista.com/babelfish/trurl_pagecontent?lp=de_en&trurl=http%3a%2f%2fde.wikipedia.org%2fwiki%2fCipher_Block_Chaining_Mode">CBC</a>.<br>
        <br><li><em></em><em>Correctness of the user password is determined</em><br>
      After a file was decoded, on the basis file is
ermitelt a Hashs (again with SHA 512) whether the file was correctly
decoded - this is not the case, is often the user password wrong.
        <br>
        <br><li><em></em><em>Command line support<br>
        </em>They can (De)Coder all instructions over the
Windows console to give, which they can implement also visually.
Thus you can implement en and decodings over a batch file or
(De)Coder in another program by call with parameters to use.
(De)Coder works in the background and does not show up with the
command line call not.<br>
        <br><li><em></em><em>Dragee and drop support<br>
        </em>They know files and files simply in (De)Coder
window to push, in order to open it.<br>
        <br><li><em></em><em>Own type of file (* dc4) - freely configurable<br>
        </em>(De)Coder 4,0 possesses its own file format that
the extension possesses DC4. Both coded files and coded files
become the DC4 files, which on user desire also (De)Coder 4,0 to be
assigned can.<br>
        <br><li><em></em><em>Context menu entry for files and files - freely
configurable<br>
        </em>On user desire can be assigned also to the files
and files a context menu entry, so that it (De)Coder still faster to
open can.<br>
        <br><li><em></em><em>Installer/Uninstaller<br>
        </em>(De)Coder 4,0 has a German-language Installer as
well as Uninstaler, in order to integrate itself optimally into the
system. It decided for the efficient and by Pascalcode
expandable <a href="http://babelfish.altavista.com/babelfish/trurl_pagecontent?lp=de_en&trurl=http%3a%2f%2fwww.jrsoftware.org%2fisinfo.php"></a>Intaller </a><a href="http://babelfish.altavista.com/babelfish/trurl_pagecontent?lp=de_en&trurl=http%3a%2f%2fwww.jrsoftware.org%2fisinfo.php">InnoSetup</a>.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Information: (De)Coder 4,0 is not compatible with
its predecessors. That means it that files, which with older
versions of (De)Coder were coded, not to be no more read in can.
Due to the small security of the old versions these more are
also not offered with the official Downloadquellen for the Download.
The Entwicker <a href="mailto:info@daniel-marschall.de">Daniel Marschall</a> offers still support for (De)Coder starting from version
3.0. If you possess old files and no more can do you over the
software, (De)Coder 3,2 to request.
    </p>
    <p>The operation of the program might be quite clear,
therefore I continue to describe the operation here also not. If
you should nevertheless ask to the program have, you can me by E-Mail
at any time ask to place.</p>
    <p>
      <b></b><b>General references</b><br>
      <br>
    Generally each file should be decoded after the
coding still once for security, in order to guarantee that everything
functioned. Pay attention also to the correct input of the
password - it is differentiated between large and lower case.
Therefore the feststelltaste should be deactivated; the
program warns you however, if this is not the case.
      <br>
      <br>
    Although with the development very much to saving resources one
paid attention, should be proceeded with caution, if larger files with
(De)Coder to be en or decoded. It can sometimes occur that the
system charges to capacity for longer time or that the procedures fail
due to too little main memory and/or to small paging file.
Particularly here it is recommended that the back decoding is
tested.
      <br>
      <br>
    (De)Coder 4,0 leads the coding and/or decoding after clicks
immediately on the hook out and provides with this process a tempoaere
file. If it comes to no errors (e.g. due to the input of a wrong
password) the user requested to indicate the goal position.
After it the tempoaere file is only shifted and renamed to the
destination. If the user breaks the request for input off or if
the en and/or decoding fails, the tempoaere file is again deleted
immediately.
      <br>
      <br>
    They should thus with each en and/or decoding exactly the same
much storage location on the medium, on which the tempoaere listing of
Windows is, keep free, like source file are large (it is somewhat more
recommended however). If you liked to code 100 MT a large file,
then still 101 MT should on the drive assembly be free - even if you
liked to store the file afterwards on another drive assembly!
      <br>
      <br>
      <b></b><b>The safety references</b><br>
      <br>
    Although (De)Coder 4,0 an extremely high security
exhibits, remains the source files, which code you, on the non
removable disk, if you do not delete these reliably. (De)Coder
offers the possibility on of deleting source files surely. The
file is several times overwritten, before it is unwiederruflich
deleted. By this option no more remainders of the source file
stay on the data medium. Note however that each file, which you
do not delete&nbsp;reliably (by overwriting&nbsp;), on
the data medium stays, until it is overwritten with new data!
      <br>
      <br>
    They should make certain with the choice of the password that it
exhibits a suitable length (to be recommended at least 10 indications)
and of letters and consists numbers. Furthermore both large and
lower case should be used. No words, which are located in
dictionaries, should&nbsp;be used. By these measures you
prevent an BruteForce attack.
    </p>
    <p>Note that there is bad-like software, which the keystrokes
of her keyboard minutes Irish can do. Thus hacker can arrive at
your password. Examine therefore your system with anti-viruses a
software.</p>
    <p><strong></strong><strong>Password forget, and now?</strong>
    </p>
    <p><strong></strong>Then you have a problem. there is no possibility of
decoding the data without correct password again.<br>

    They can (De)Coder also over the command line to

    (De)Coder is started
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>CODER [ file name ]</b><br>
      <br>
    If "file name" is a file, then (De)Coder started
and opened the file. It can concern around an unencrypted file
or a coded file and/or a coded file.
      <br>
      <br>
    If "file name" is a file, then (De)Coder started and the files
opened.

    Safe deletion of files
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>One indicates /c, then the source data remain.
      <li>
      With the instruction one /x the source data (with a file
all elements with Unterordnern) are unwiederruflich deleted surely by
repeated <i></i>overwriting</i>
       (if no error
arose). Also write protected files are deleted.

  Automatic recognition of coding and decoding
    <ul>
      <li>If input is a coded file, it is decoded after
expenditure
      <li>If input is a coded file, it is provided decoded
with its original name in expenditure
      <li>
      If input is a not coded file, it is coded after
expenditure<br>

nevertheless must be it valid inputs (integers within the valid
range) <li>If input is a file, it is packed and coded after
expenditure

    </ul>
  If an element with the name is present already
    <ul>
      <li>Already if a listing with the original name is
present during the file decoding in expenditure, an alternative name
is selected.
      <li>If expenditure is already present with a coding, it is
overwritten.
      </li>
    </ul>
  Control of the file name extensions
    <ul>
      <li>If expenditure does not have the extension "dc4"
with a coding, this indication is added.
      <li>If expenditure has the extension "dc4" with a decoding,
this indication is removed.
      </li>
    </ul>
  Notes
    <ul>
      <li>If the expenditure listing does not exist, then
all sublists are provided automatically.
      <li>If you liked to decode the file into the same listing,
then you indicate one point (.) as expenditure&nbsp;- an empty
input for the parameter "expenditure" would cause a syntax error.

    <p><strong>Error level</strong>

    <p>(De)Coder works at the last variant exclusive in
the background and spends to no messages (e.g. errors). Around
errors to diagnosing, so-called error levels are spent by the program.</p>
    <p>The following error levels exist:</p>
    <p><code>Errorlevel 0 = Kein Fehler<br>
      Errorlevel 1 = DC4 Datei besch&auml;digt
        <br>

  (De)Coder determines the tempoaere listing of your
system and/or the up-to-date announced user. With Windows 9x
this usual-white is "C:\WINDOWS\TEMP", with Windows XP "C:\Dokumente
and Einstellungen\Benutzername\Lokale Einstellungen\Temp \".

  The program provides the following files:
    <br>
    <p></p>
    <ul>
      <li>DeCoder_[Random number].zip: If one opens a file for coding, he is
gepacket as. Subsequently, the tempoaere ZIP file is opened.
      <li>DeCoder_[Random number].zip: One provides, if one decodes a coded
file. It is the file, which is contained of the CD4 actually in.
      <li>DeCoder_[Random number].tmp: If a file is en or is decoded, it is
only stored as DeCoder.tmp. If the en or decoding fails, then
the target file is overwritten unnecessarily. The tempoaere file
is renamed afterwards to the user choice.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Since these files contain sensitive data delete (De)Coder
this immediately after completion of the process and examines on
completion of the Progamms still once whether the files were also
deleted and deletes these if necessary. Before the deletion of
these speed eras files these are overwritten still once completely
with data (Hex Pattern 00h), so that no arrears on the non removable
disk remain.<br><br>Should (De)Coder not to be duly terminated
(e.g. by a power failure or an immediate completion of the process),
the speed eras remain files. (De)Coder puts on several tempoaere files,
so that also several windows can be at the same time opened and worked.
They should destroy all files, which have the structure &quot;DeCoder_*.zip&quot;
as well as &quot;DeCoder_*.tmp&quot;, with a safety software.<br>
